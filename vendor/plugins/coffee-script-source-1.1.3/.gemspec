description: "      CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.\n \\     Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons,\n      JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart.\n      CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript\n      in a simple way.\n"
